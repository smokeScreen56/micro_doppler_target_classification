# Micro-Doppler Based Target Classification

This project focuses on simulation-based classification of moving targets
(walking human, crawling soldier, drone, vehicle) using radar micro-Doppler
signatures.

## Project Scope
- Radar signal simulation and processing
- FFT and time-frequency analysis
- Feature extraction using spectrograms
- Target classification using machine learning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MATLAB
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning (CNN / RNN)

## Dataset

This project uses the **CI4R-MULTI3 24 GHz Micro-Doppler Spectrogram Dataset**.
